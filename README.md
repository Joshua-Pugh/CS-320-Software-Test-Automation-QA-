# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can follow some best practices such as secure coding to ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure. Some secure coding examples are coding standards and conventions, the use of only safe functions, code analysis tools, handling data safely, and handling errors to prevent security gaps. Testing is also another good way to ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
When interpreting the user's needs, I carefully read over the requirements many times to ensure that I understand what the expected outcome of the program should be. I then began planning the best way to implement the requirements into the program. Once I have a plan in place I begin coding the program and testing the code as I go to ensure it meets the requirements until all the requirements have been implemented.

# How do I approach designing software?
The way I approach designing software is to be diligent in understanding the needs and requirements of the design. If I am unsure of something I do some research until I find the answers and am confident in that conclusion. I plan out how each of the requirements will fit into the design and then make sure the finished product meets the minimum requirements first. I then test my code and look for places were improvements can be made. I always do my best to provide the best possible result.
